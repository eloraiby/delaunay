# C-Sharp Delaunay Implementation

## About
All C-Sharp source is a derivative port of "Relatively Robust Divide and Conquer 2D Delaunay Construction Algorithm" by Wael El Oraiby. Porting work was done by David V. Makray.

## Usage
The Delaunay implementation is wraped in the Delaunay class in Delaunay.cs. The GUI demonstration code is in CSDelaunayDemo.cs. Development was done in MonoDevelop. Building and running the demo should be as simple as loading the solution file "CSDelaunay.sln" in MonoDevelop. Visual Studio should load the project too but it is untested.

## Source Code Status
The C-Sharp Delaunay code is a minimal translation from the Java source, which is more-or-less a straight port from the C implementation. See the README.md in the Java directory for further notes on the current status of the source code.
